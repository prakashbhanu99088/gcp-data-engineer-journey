# GCP Data Engineering Journey

## Day 
- Environment setup (Python, Git, Docker, VS Code)
- Created and ran first Python script
## Day 2
- Practiced Python functions
- Created and read CSV data
- Computed metrics from file-based data

## Day 3
- Pulled data from a public API and saved raw JSON
- Parsed JSON using Python and extracted fields (name, country)
- Computed basic counts from JSON data

## Day 4
